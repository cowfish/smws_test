	"description": "An initial blast of sweetness greets the nose – banana bread, Madeleines, flapjacks and fudge – then a note of orange pomanders and Christmas spice, before we enter the dusty woody world of a Narnia wardrobe. The palate is a total mouth experience, flooding the senses with youthful intensity and immediacy – orange peel, clove and coltsfoot rock. The reduced nose is a warming winter hearth, pine tree freshness, citrus, gentle spice and eggnog – all seasonal comfort and cheer. The palate now combines numbing nutmeg, cinnamon-spiced pastries and sweet lebkuchen – very attractive, very drinkable and full of seasonal charm – a truly effective winter warmer.",
